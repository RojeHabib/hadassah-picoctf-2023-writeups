# Hints
1.What does meta mean in the context of files? 
2.Ever heard of metadata?

# Initial look
image named "pico_img.png" contain hidden text

# How to solve it
I downloaded the image to the computer, opened the command prompt in the same folder where the image is located.
I wrote the command 'findstr "pico" pico_img.png', the command actually searches for the word "pico"
(a word found in the flag I'm looking for) inside the image.
After I wrote the command, the flag was printed in the command prompt.

And I'm done  ðŸ˜„
