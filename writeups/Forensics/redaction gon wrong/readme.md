Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

## Hints
1. How can you be sure of the redaction?

## Initial look
i downloaded the givven pdf file and when i opened it i saw the part 
of it is hidden from me and i understood that i need to find to hidden part. 

# How to solve it

i went to to clue that
said: "How can you be sure of the redaction?" and i understood the the redaction maybe wan't that good.
so in order to find the hiiden part i used Convert PDF To Text website to convert my pdf to text because i
wanted to see my file in it's initial form. after i did it i downloaded the text file that i got from the 
converter and i saw the full text include the hidden parts. in addution i saw the hidden flag:
picoCTF{C4n_Y0u_S33_m3_fully} and than i submutted the flug and finished the exersize.
